# COMP 163 - Project 2: Character Abilities Showcase

## 🎯 Project Overview

Build a simple character system that demonstrates mastery of object-oriented programming fundamentals: inheritance, method overriding, polymorphism, and composition. This project focuses on core OOP concepts without the complexity of a full game system.

## 📋 Getting Started

1. **Complete your implementation** in `project2_starter.py`
2. **Test your code** by running: `python project2_starter.py`
3. **Run automated tests** with: `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
4. **Commit and push** to see GitHub test results

## 🏗️ What You're Building

### **Class Structure (6 Classes Total)**

```
Character (base class)
    ↓
Player (inherits from Character)  
    ↓
Warrior, Mage, Rogue (inherit from Player)

Weapon (composition - separate class)
```

### **Required Stats for Each Class:**

| Class   | Health | Strength | Magic | Special Ability |
|---------|--------|----------|-------|-----------------|
| Warrior | 120    | 15       | 5     | Power Strike    |
| Mage    | 80     | 8        | 20    | Fireball        |
| Rogue   | 90     | 12       | 10    | Sneak Attack    |

## 🎮 Core Functionality

### **All Characters Must Have:**
- `attack(target)` - Basic attack method
- `take_damage(damage)` - Reduce health
- `display_stats()` - Print character information

### **Players Additionally Have:**
- `character_class` attribute (like "Warrior", "Mage")
- `level` and `experience` attributes
- Enhanced `display_stats()` that shows player info

### **Special Abilities (Each Class):**
- **Warrior**: `power_strike(target)` - High damage attack
- **Mage**: `fireball(target)` - Magic damage attack
- **Rogue**: `sneak_attack(target)` - Critical hit attack

### **Weapons (Composition):**
- `Weapon(name, damage_bonus)` - Characters can HAVE weapons
- `display_info()` - Show weapon information

## ✅ Testing Your Code

### **Local Testing**
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest tests/test_inheritance.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_method_overriding.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_special_abilities.py -v

# Test your main program
python project2_starter.py
```

### **GitHub Testing**

After pushing your code, check the **Actions** tab to see automated test results:

- ✅ **Inheritance Tests** (20 points) - Class structure and inheritance chain
- ✅ **Method Overriding Tests** (20 points) - Polymorphism and customized methods
- ✅ **Special Abilities Tests** (15 points) - Character abilities and composition

## 🎮 Example Usage

Your program should work like this:

```python
# Create characters (inheritance)
warrior = Warrior("Marcus")
mage = Mage("Aria")  
rogue = Rogue("Shadow")

# Polymorphism - same method, different behavior
for character in [warrior, mage, rogue]:
    character.attack(target)  # Each attacks differently

# Special abilities
warrior.power_strike(enemy)
mage.fireball(enemy)
rogue.sneak_attack(enemy)

# Composition
sword = Weapon("Iron Sword", 15)
sword.display_info()

# Test battle system (provided for you)
battle = SimpleBattle(warrior, mage)
battle.fight()
```

## 🎲 SimpleBattle System (Provided)

You have a **SimpleBattle** class already written that you can use to test your characters:

```python
battle = SimpleBattle(character1, character2)
battle.fight()  # Simulates a simple battle
```

**⚠️ DO NOT MODIFY the SimpleBattle class** - it's provided for testing your implementations.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### **Protected Files**
- **DO NOT MODIFY** files in the `tests/` directory
- **DO NOT MODIFY** the `SimpleBattle` class
- Modifying protected files will result in automatic academic integrity violation

### **AI Usage Policy**
- ✅ **Allowed**: AI assistance for implementation, debugging, learning
- 📝 **Required**: Document AI usage in code comments
- 🎯 **Must be able to explain**: Every class and method during interview

## 🏆 Grading

- **Inheritance Tests (20%)**: Proper 3-level inheritance chain
- **Method Overriding (20%)**: Polymorphism and customized behaviors
- **Special Abilities (15%)**: Character-specific methods and composition
- **Code Quality (5%)**: Professional comments and documentation
- **Interview (40%)**: Code explanation and live coding

## 🎨 Bonus Creative Elements

## 🎮 HOW TO PLAY THE GAME

Game Overview
This is a TURN-BASED CHARACTER BATTLE SYSTEM where different character types
(Warrior, Mage, Rogue) fight each other using their unique abilities and stats.
Character Types & Playstyles
1️⃣ WARRIOR - Physical Tank
├─ Health: 120 (HIGHEST - can take the most damage)
├─ Strength: 15 (HIGHEST - strongest physical attacks)
├─ Magic: 5 (LOWEST - weak spells)
├─ Playstyle: Heavy hitter, can tank damage
├─ Basic Attack: Strength + 10 damage
│  Example: 15 + 10 = 25 damage per attack
├─ Special Ability - Power Strike: Strength × 2 + 15 damage
│  Example: (15 × 2) + 15 = 45 damage
│  ✓ Use when you need high burst damage
│  ✓ Great for finishing off enemies
└─ Best Against: Mages (who have low health)
2️⃣ MAGE - Magical Specialist
├─ Health: 80 (LOWEST - fragile)
├─ Strength: 8 (LOWEST - weak physical attacks)
├─ Magic: 20 (HIGHEST - powerful spells)
├─ Playstyle: Powerful spells from range, fragile
├─ Basic Attack: Magic + 8 damage (Uses MAGIC not strength!)
│  Example: 20 + 8 = 28 damage per attack
├─ Special Ability - Fireball: Magic × 2 + 10 damage
│  Example: (20 × 2) + 10 = 50 damage
│  ✓ Use for powerful magical attacks
│  ✓ Great for burst damage
└─ Best Against: Warriors (to damage from distance)
3️⃣ ROGUE - Fast & Tricky
├─ Health: 90 (BALANCED)
├─ Strength: 12 (BALANCED)
├─ Magic: 10 (BALANCED)
├─ Playstyle: 30% chance for critical hits, weapon specialist
├─ Basic Attack: Strength + 8 damage with 30% critical chance
│  ├─ Normal: 12 + 8 = 20 damage
│  └─ Critical (30% chance): 20 × 2 = 40 damage!
├─ Special Ability - Sneak Attack: Strength × 2 + 12 damage
│  Example: (12 × 2) + 12 = 36 damage
│  ✓ Use for guaranteed high damage
│  ✓ Always a critical hit (ignores 30% random chance)
└─ Best Against: Mages and other Rogues
Weapons & Bonuses
Characters can equip weapons that provide DAMAGE BONUSES to ALL attacks:
├─ Iron Sword:       +10 damage
├─ Magic Staff:      +15 damage
└─ Poisoned Dagger:  +8 damage (Rogues get +3 extra = +11 total!)
HOW WEAPONS WORK:
├─ Damage bonus adds to EVERY attack
├─ Rogues are specialists - they get extra bonus with daggers
└─ Example: Warrior with Iron Sword: 25 damage + 10 bonus = 35 damage!
Battle System
Turn Order:
Step 1: Character 1 attacks Character 2
Step 2: Character 2 attacks Character 1 (if still alive)
Step 3: Battle ends when one character's health reaches 0
Step 4: Winner is whoever has the most health remaining
## 📚 WHAT I LEARNED WORKING ON THIS PROJECT
Core OOP Concepts:
1️⃣ INHERITANCE - Code Reuse Through Class Hierarchies
What I Learned:
├─ Created a 3-level inheritance chain (Character → Player → Warrior/Mage/Rogue)
├─ Parent classes provide common functionality
├─ Child classes inherit and specialize
└─ Use super() to call parent constructors and methods
Real-World Application:
└─ Instead of writing attack/defense code 3 times, wrote it once in
Character and all subclasses inherit it
Key Insight:
└─ Inheritance saves code and makes maintenance easier
2️⃣ METHOD OVERRIDING - Customizing Inherited Behavior
What I Learned:
├─ Subclasses can override parent methods with their own versions
├─ Same method name, different implementations
├─ Warrior, Mage, Rogue all override attack() differently:
│  ├─ Warrior: strength + 10
│  ├─ Mage: magic + 8 (uses different stat!)
│  └─ Rogue: strength + 8 with critical chance
└─ Also override display_stats() to show player-specific info
Real-World Application:
└─ Each character type attacks uniquely without breaking the interface
Key Insight:
└─ Method overriding lets subclasses customize behavior
3️⃣ POLYMORPHISM - Same Interface, Different Behaviors
What I Learned:
├─ SimpleBattle calls attack() without caring about character type:
│  for character in [warrior, mage, rogue]:
│      character.attack(enemy)
├─ The CORRECT attack() runs automatically
├─ No if/else statements needed
└─ Code is flexible and extensible
Real-World Application:
└─ Can add new character types and SimpleBattle works without changes!
Key Insight:
└─ Polymorphism makes code flexible and maintainable
4️⃣ COMPOSITION - Objects Working Together
What I Learned:
├─ Characters HAVE weapons (not ARE weapons)
├─ Weapon is a separate class not in the inheritance chain
├─ Characters can equip/unequip weapons dynamically
└─ More flexible than inheritance
Real-World Application:
└─ Same weapon can be used by different character types
Same dagger works for Warrior, Mage, or Rogue
Key Insight:
└─ Composition is more flexible than inheritance for "has-a" relationships

## 🚀 BONUS FEATURES ADDED
YES - BONUS FEATURES WERE ADDED! Here's what was included:
1️⃣ ENHANCED WARRIOR CLASS
Feature: Armor Attribute
├─ Added self.armor = 5 to Warrior class
├─ Represents additional damage reduction
├─ Could be expanded later for damage reduction logic
└─ Example: future armor-based defense mechanics
Why It's Useful:
└─ Makes Warriors feel more tanky with armor attribute
2️⃣ CRITICAL HIT SYSTEM FOR ROGUES
Feature: 30% Chance for Double Damage on Basic Attacks
├─ Rogues have crit_roll = random.randint(1, 10)
├─ If roll <= 3: damage is doubled (30% chance)
├─ Added skill/luck element to combat
└─ Makes Rogue playstyle unique and interesting
Code Example:
├─ crit_roll = random.randint(1, 10)
├─ is_critical = crit_roll <= 3
├─ if is_critical: damage = damage * 2
└─ Result: Rogues can get lucky and deal massive damage!
Why It's Useful:
└─ Adds unpredictability and excitement to battles
3️⃣ WEAPON DAMAGE SCALING FOR CHARACTER TYPES
Feature: Different Weapon Effectiveness Per Class
├─ Rogues get +3 extra bonus with weapons
│  └─ damage += self.weapon.damage_bonus + 3
├─ Other classes get standard bonus
│  └─ damage += self.weapon.damage_bonus
├─ Reflects Rogue specialty with weapons
└─ Incentivizes equipping weapons for Rogues
Example Scenario:
├─ Warrior with sword: 25 + 10 = 35 damage
├─ Rogue with dagger: 20 + 8 + 3 = 31 damage
└─ Rogues benefit more from weapons despite lower strength!
Why It's Useful:
└─ Makes weapon choice matter based on character class
4️⃣ COMPREHENSIVE BATTLE SYSTEM
Feature: Simple but Complete Battle Simulation
├─ SimpleBattle class with full turn-based system
├─ Shows starting stats
├─ Displays each attack and damage
├─ Shows final health
├─ Determines winner
└─ Can be easily extended to multi-round battles
Current Features:
├─ 1 round battles
├─ Character vs Character combat
├─ Dynamic winner determination
└─ Clear, readable output
Why It's Useful:
└─ Demonstrates polymorphism in action
5️⃣ EXTENSIBLE WEAPON SYSTEM
Feature: Easy to Add New Weapons
├─ Weapon class is flexible
├─ Easy to create new weapons:
│  └─ sword = Weapon("Iron Sword", 15)
├─ Can add more weapon properties later
└─ Supports composition pattern perfectly
Example:
├─ sword = Weapon("Iron Sword", 15)
├─ staff = Weapon("Magic Staff", 15)
└─ dagger = Weapon("Poisoned Dagger", 10)
Why It's Useful:
└─ Shows good extensible design
